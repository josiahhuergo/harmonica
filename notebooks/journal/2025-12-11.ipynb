    "I'll just jump to where I'm at so far, because I really like where I've brought this idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the idea is that you have something like automation curves - a set of points distributed over time that are interpolated between, and where a note's onset sits on this curve determines the velocity that it triggers with.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the first part of the idea, is just the mechanics of defining a set of points, how they're interpolated, and an algorithm that calculates the velocity value at any given point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the idea is designing a procedure for generating a cyclical pattern of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will start with the first part of the idea, because the second part of the idea is dependent on its existence."

    "I want to have a class `VelocityGraph`. The primary function of the graph is this: you evaluate it at a specific time, and it returns a velocity value.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The first is the set of points. This will just be a list of ordered pairs, `(onset, velocity)`.\n",

    "The second will be a set of interpolation algorithms. Which interpolation algorithm you use determines what velocity value is returned when evaluating the graph at a specific time.\n",
    "\n",

    "This seems to be the simplest algorithm. You simply find the point p nearest to t that satisfies p[0] <= t, and return p[1].\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we find the nearest point? Well, I guess we iterate through the points to start. \n",
    "\n",
    "With any of these algorithms, if there aren't any points, then we just return a value of 1 by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's keep things simple by assuming the first point is at t=0, and there are points at every integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are evaluating at t=5 1/2.\n",

    "Well, let's think through this. If I carried on with this approach, how would it actually be used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, at some point, you have to populate a container full of data. For example, time functions may calculate values in a lazy \"on-demand\" way, sure, but eventually, you DO have to populate a clip full of events, and those events have onset times, and those onset times are calculated by a time function.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's think backwards here from our use case. We have a piano part or something, and we want to impose a velocity pattern over it. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we're going to iterate through each note in the clip, and for each note, we ask \"what is the velocity at this time in our graph?\"\n",

    "\n",
    "That is to say, we are looking for the two closest neighbors of t that satisfy p1 <= t <= p2. \n",
    "\n",
    "But the thing is, we have to calculate those points on the spot based on an algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, once we finally do calculate those (somehow), we have to interpolate between them. This step depends on the interpolation algorithm we're using.\n",
    "\n",
