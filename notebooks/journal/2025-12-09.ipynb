    "You have a pitch class set like `{0,2,3,5,7,8,10} mod 12 root 0`, and then you have an index set like `{0,2,4} mod 7 root 0` representing a triad.\n",
    "\n",
    "You select pitches from the pcset with this index set, and it yields `{0,3,7} mod 12 root 0`. Now, to do diatonic transposition, you transpose the index class set, not the pitch class set, and then you select with it.\n",

    "The question is, how do you implement this?\n",
