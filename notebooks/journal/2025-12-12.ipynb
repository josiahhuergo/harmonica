    "# More velocity graph shit\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, picking back up on [yesterday's work...](2025-12-11.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "I have some more thoughts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## You don't need that many subdivisions\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only so much detail required in meter. There is a point where further subdivisions of a meter cease to be meaningful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like, if two drums are only like, 10ms apart, or some other sufficiently small time delta, then they stop being perceived as distinct events and blend into a single texture.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An idea for building velocity patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I think you start by specifying the base pattern with an onset function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `OnsetFunc([1 1/2, 2 1/2], offset=1/2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you can subdivide this by calling `.subdivide` or something with another onset function as the argument, returning a new meter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time resolution matching\n",
    "\n",
    "One open question: is it meaningful to impose a velocity graph that expresses one meter over a clip that expresses another?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the meter of the clip in question follows a straight 16th note 4/4 type rhythm, is it meaningful to impose a velocity graph over it that follows a 9/8 triplet type rhythm?\n",
    "\n",
    "My guess is that this is probably dependent on the interpolation being used. Maybe less likely with sample and hold, and more likely with linear or exponential etc interpolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to investigate this question. \n",
    "\n",
    "And maybe speaking in terms of \"meter\" isn't the best. Because meter is also about the pattern of stressed and unstressed notes. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think it's more specific to say \"resolution\". By resolution, I mean the resolution of the time grid that onsets fall on. Maybe some onsets fall on multiples of 1, and some fall on multiples of 1/2, and some fall on multiples of 1/3. That means there's a resolution of 1/6, because `1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6`. I think the way to calculate the resolution is to take inventory of all prime subdivisions of the beat that are present, and multiply the smallest of these together. In this case, the prime subdivisions present are 2 and 3. The smallest 2-subdivision is 1/2, and the smallest 3-subdivision is 1/3, so you multiply them to get 1/6. That's my guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyways, I think it's most meaningful to match clips with velocity graphs that have the same time resolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if the time resolution of a clip is 1/6 a beat, then it's probably best to impose a velocity graph that also has a time resolution of 1/6."

    "## Returning to pattern building\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so my question - is it as simple as stacking layers of onset patterns? Perhaps so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you just say, \"Here's our first onset pattern, and it has a velocity of 1.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Let's subdivide it with this second onset pattern, and give it a velocity of 2/3.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Let's subdivide that with this third onset pattern, and give it a velocity of 1/3.\"\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The patterns can be specified in terms of deltas.\n",
    "\n",
    "[3/2, 1]. That's the first level.\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in an onset pattern [3/2, 5/2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe it's just a matter of partitioning each delta into smaller deltas.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a partitioning problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, I worked this out on paper, and here's what I got.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The subdivision algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "So basically, you might as well start out with a specific resolution in mind. Let's say the resolution is 1/4 a beat - sixteenth notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you decide on a region of time to partition. I want to do something with a time signature of 5/8, so let's partition 10/4 beats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you simply start partitioning this region iteratively. We decide on our first partition - this also includes the possibility of not partitioning at all, which would basically just result in the first subdivision consisting of a single onset. In our case, we partition 10 into 6 and 4. Then we assign this first level a velocity. We'll choose 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note about velocities: the basic idea is that velocities diminish with each finer level, but technically you don't have to follow this if you really don't wanna?\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyways, after each subdivision, we're left with two choices. We can either continue subdividing like we just did, or we can do one final subdivision that wraps up the process by subdividing everything into our smallest unit - the resolution unit, or w/e you wanna call it - in this case, 1/4. This would be the final subdivision level, and it would also be assigned a velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, if we just wanna repeat the subdivision process, then we take our previous partition and we partition each of its parts again.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have 6/4 and 4/4. We can partition 6 into 3 and 3, giving us 3/4 and 3/4. And 4/4 can be partitions into 2/4 and 2/4. So our next partition level is [3/4, 3/4, 2/4, 2/4], and we assign it a velocity of 2/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note about partitions: A number is its own partition, so if we have any parts that we just don't want to partition on any given subdivision level, we can just do that. For example, if we wanted to further subdivide 3/4 and 3/4 into parts, but leave 2/4 and 2/4 alone, then that can be how it is on one level. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Side thought\n",
    "\n",
    "What if the region of time has a different resolution than the one we declare?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like, what if we want the resolution to be 1/4, but the region of time is 1 1/7?\n",
    "\n",
    "You could take the remainder of this region, when divided by the resolution, and treat it as a resolution unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we implement all this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Not sure. Let me try stuff."
