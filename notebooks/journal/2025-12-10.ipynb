    "There should be stress patterns, but tied to onsets. Like, pairs `(onset, velocity)`. Perhaps there could be some kind of structure that models meter this way?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The times 0, 1, 2, 3 have a velocity of 1. But 1/2, 1 1/2, 2 1/2 and 3 1/2 have a velocity of 2/3. \n",

    "\n",
    "Isn't that fun? I wonder if it'd make sense to have it follow some kind of curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you build it with iterative levels of detail. Maybe with each level of offbeats you \"fill in\", the velocity approaches some limit. You might not want it to go totally silent on the most off of beats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this is that you can take a clip, and then easily impose a stress pattern over it that emphasizes some sort of meter.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would this work, though? I guess you'd specify the first level rhythm, like `[0, 1, 1 1/2, 2 1/2, 3 1/2] mod 4`, and assign it a velocity like 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you specify the second level rhythm, where the onsets of successive levels will be inbetween the combined onsets of all the previous levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it could be `[1/2, 1 1/4, 1 3/4, 2, 3, 3 3/4] mod 4`, assigned a velocity like 2/3. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next level could be `[1/4, 3/4, 1 1/8, 1 3/8, 1 5/8, 1 7/8, 2 1/4, 2 3/4, 3 1/4, 3 7/8] mod 4` and be assigned a velocity of 1/3.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's an interesting idea. The basic structure is simple enough, but two open questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How are vleocities assigned to each level? Why choose 1, 2/3, and 1/3? Do they have to be in descreasing order?\n",
    "2. How are new subdivisions chosen? In this example, I simply chose points that were halfway between existing points in previous levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "That last queston is especially interesting to me. Why even choose evenly spaced points? After all, the points in the first level certainly aren't evenly spaced.\n",
    "Nor would you want them to be if you're modelling irregular meters!"
