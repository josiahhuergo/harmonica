    "# Chord voicings\n",
    "\n",
    "I will speak of chords in a way that is much less nuanced than how they're typically spoken of in music theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, there are two ideas that fall under the category of \"chords\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The first are what can be thought of as _classes_ of chords, which are represented by pitch class sets, and are essentially equivalent to what I typically call \"scales\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The second are what can be thought of as chord _voicings_, which are represented by pitch sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can have a chord like Cmaj7, represented by the pitch class set `{0, 4, 7, 11} mod 12 root 0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this as an entire class of chords. From it, we can build many specific voicings by constructing pitch sets from this pitch class set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A notation for writing out voicings\n",
    "\n",
    "I've come to find that it's easiest to write out voicings by permuting the pitch classes, and then translating them to pitches.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: `[0, 4, 11, 7]` is a permutation of pitch classes (mod 12) which represents the pitch set `{0, 4, 11, 19}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplifies the algorithm for enumerating chord voicings, because it simply becomes a matter of enumerating permutations of pitch classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to translate these into pitch sets, we'll need a function that adds an appropriate number of octaves to each pitch class."
