    "\n",
    "I mean, just look at our results. The pitch class sequence `[4,11,0]`, for example. When we derive pitch sequences from this and are only \n",
    "considering a fixed range of 60 through 71, we get sequences like `[64,71,60]`, but what about `[64,71,72]`? What about `[64,59,60]`? \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this kinda sucks is because we're getting an incomplete account of the intervallic \"shapes\" that can be derived from a given \n",
    "pitch class sequence. Intervals are a _very important feature_ of any pitch structure, so if our goal is to capture entire swathes of musical possibilities, \n",
    "then we should aim to enumerate all possible intervallic structures from a sequence of pitch classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The cooler approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what you do. You take your pitch class sequence, like `[4,11,0]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You start with the first pitch class, 4. You pick an octave, or register, or whatever you want to call it - y'know, `12x + 4`. \n",
    "28, 40, 52, whatever. Let's just stick with 4 to keep things simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, lets consider the movement from 4 to 11. When moving from one pitch class to another, you have two parameters: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Direction\n",
    "2. Magnitude\n",
    "\n",
    "When moving from 4 to 11, you can move either up or down. Then, you can add some amount of octaves to the movement. \n",
    "\n",
    "So you can move up to 11, 23, 35... Or, you can move down to -1, -13, -25...\n",
    "\n",
    "The only exception to this is when a pitch class moves to itself, in which case you have another choice aside from moving up or down, \n",
    "which is to not move at all. +/- 0."
